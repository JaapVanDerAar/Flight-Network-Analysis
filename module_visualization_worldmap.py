### MODULE_VISUALIZATION_WORLDMAP.PY

### This is the visualisation on worldmap module. In here you can find several functions:

### - Functions for creating variables necessary for visualisation
### - Functions necessary for other visualisation options
### - Functions to create the visualisation on the worldmap
### - Functions that include a program for the demo and the visualisation on worldmap
